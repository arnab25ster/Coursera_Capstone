    "The project centers around two major North American cities across two countries namely New York (USA) and Toronto (Canada). The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. It will also help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods.\n",

    "There are often scenarios when people migrate from New-York to Toronto or vice-versa for job or in search of better opportunity/livelihood. Most of us while migrating to a new neighborhood are unaware of itâ€™s pros and cons. Each individual have their own preference, like for example one like to have a fresh cup of coffee before going to work and have food on the way while coming back home. So he/she will be interested to stay near certain place where both coffee and restaurant are in close proximity. ( This again depends on each individuals preference and choices)\n",
